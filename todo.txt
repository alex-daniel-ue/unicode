- Blocks some levels deep shouldn't get rendered (or be invisible) when previewing?
- finally do block text and basic functions 

- Block text handling
	- () Parentheses are value blocks
	- [] Square brackets are value blocks for enums
	- <> Angle brackets are expression blocks

function (name) (arg/s)/[enum]
move [directions]
print/say (string)

declare variable (name)
set variable [name from var_list] to (value)
(value) [operation] (value)

if <condition>

while <>

for {value} in (list)
repeat ()

	set variable [name] to (value)
- array demonstration
	
- for loop
	expose array
