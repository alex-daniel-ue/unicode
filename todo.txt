- Sockets in upper lips
- Interpreter
- Selection functionality
- Highlight hovered Blocks
	- Modify self-modulate or apply outline shader on mouse_entered/mouse_exited
- Easy formatting text in labels in upper lips

## BUGS:
- Drop preview essentially always hovers on the preview, but only updates once it goes below half.
	Refactor to this: provide dead space in the center, and if it goes above or below, -1 and +1.
- Make UpperLip have a NinePatchRect itself, so LowerLip doesn't expand too, or make LowerLip a
	static TextureRect.
- Long blocks mysteriously disappearing, maybe not being added or removed?

## REFACTORING:
- Separate Preview and Selection into different Nodes in PuzzleCanvas
- Refactor NestedBlock._drop_data()
