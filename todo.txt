- Preview functionality
	- Maybe since preview would already calculate accurate position, maybe
		use that instead of calculating it in _drop_data
- Highlight hovered Blocks
	- Modify self-modulate or apply outline shader on mouse_entered/mouse_exited
- Formatting text in labels inside upper lips
- Dropping blocks inside sockets in upper lips
- Selection functionality
- Separate Preview and Selection into different Nodes in PuzzleCanvas

## BUGS
- When inbetween two blocks close together, _this_idx changes rapidly
	- Because of preview, I have to calculate the initial sizes/heights/ranges whatever
	without the preview when calculating preview idx.........
