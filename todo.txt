- Preview functionality in NestedBlocks
	- Use gui_get_hovered_control and gui_is_dragging
	- Unfortunately have to poll every frame, as long as gui_is_dragging
		- Maybe only one Node has to poll, probably PuzzleCanvas
	- Must dynamically change child position as drag position changes
		- Maybe since preview would already calculate accurate position, maybe
			use that instead of calculating it in _drop_data
- Highlight hovered Blocks
	- Modify self-modulate or apply outline shader on mouse_entered/mouse_exited
