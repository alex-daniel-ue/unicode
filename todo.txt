- Sockets in upper lips
	- Don't bother implementing previews, just highlight when hovered over
- Expression and value blocks
	- Diamond and circular block textures
- Cap/start block
	- Use NestedBlock with cap/start texture
	- UpperLip will cover whole texture
- Interpreter
- Multi-selection functionality
	- Write in own Node
	- Should be pretty easy? Just wrap all selected Blocks in a Control, then when
	dropped, dump all nodes on target?
- Slightly highlight hovered Blocks
	- Modify self-modulate or apply outline shader on mouse_entered/mouse_exited/gui_input
- Easy formatting text in labels in UpperLips, use @tool
- Interlocking textures illusion

## BUGS:
- Make UpperLip have a NinePatchRect itself, so LowerLip doesn't expand too, or
	make LowerLip a static TextureRect.
	- Automatically cut textures?
- All Blocks inside a NestedBlock resize to longest Block
	- Solution: dynamically change size flags to ShrinkBegin, but it doesn't work
