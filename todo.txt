- Sockets in upper lips
- Interpreter
- Selection functionality
	- Write in own Node
- Highlight hovered Blocks
	- Modify self-modulate or apply outline shader on mouse_entered/mouse_exited
- Easy formatting text in labels in UpperLips

## BUGS:
- Make UpperLip have a NinePatchRect itself, so LowerLip doesn't expand too, or make LowerLip a
	static TextureRect.
- All Blocks inside a NestedBlock resize to longest Block
	- Dynamically change size flags to ShrinkBegin
- Container selection for LowerLips
	- To replicate, there is a spot in LowerLip where if you hover a Statement,
	it will flicker back-and-forth between above the NestedBlock and inside it
	- Why would there be a spot on LowerLip where it would ever return the parent
	container and probably the NestedBlock's index?
- Index selection in general
	- Flickers for 3-5 times for Statements
	- Flickers infinitely for Statements and NestedBlocks
