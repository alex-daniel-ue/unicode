- Value blocks
	- Diamond and circular block textures
- Cap/start block
	- Use NestedBlock with cap/start texture
	- UpperLip will cover whole texture
- Interpreter
- Multi-selection functionality
	- Write in own Node
	- Should be pretty easy? Just wrap all selected Blocks in a Control, then when
	dropped, dump all nodes on target?
- Slightly highlight hovered Blocks
	- Modify self-modulate or apply outline shader on mouse_entered/mouse_exited/gui_input
- Easy formatting text in labels in UpperLips, use @tool
- Interlocking Blocks illusion

## BUGS:
- DropPreviewHandler's intended functionality for bigger previews (threshold closer
	to center when neighbors are smaller than drop_preview) doesn't work at the
	moment, as you need to hover on Blocks to overtake them.
- Weird "Node not found" bug, replicate through:
	- NestedBlock ( NestedBlock, NestedBlock ) or
	- NestedBlock ( Statement, NestedBlock ( Statement ), Statement)
- Bug in update_thresholds, with NestedBlocks with Blocks inside, specifically
	when it's the first or last, maybe something with detecting the preview itself?
