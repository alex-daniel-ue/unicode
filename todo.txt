- Blocks some levels deep shouldn't get rendered (or be invisible) when previewing?
- player shouldn't be able to drag blocks inside blocks (like pre-set socketed blocks)
- finally do block text and basic functions 

- Block text handling
	- () Parentheses are value sockets, (text) for uneditable value blocks
	- [] Square brackets are value blocks for enums
	- <> Angle brackets are expression blocks
	- {} Curly brackets for blocks inside, semicolon delimiter

- 

- will blocks have nested blocks 

input value blocks
socket value blocks

function (name) (arg/s)/[enum]
move [directions]
print/say (string)

declare variable (name)
set variable [name from var_list] to (value)
(value) [operation] (value)

if <condition>

while <>

for {value} in (list)
repeat ()

exercises
- function demonstration
	expose function and basic say
- variable declaration & initialization
	declare (name)
	set variable [name] to (value)
- array demonstration
	
- for loop
	expose array
	declare (counter)
	declare (item)
	while <>
- repeat ()
	use for block and range block
