TODO:
- reformat parse block data, make more like .format method where {} represents .tres separated by raw labels

TEMPLATE BLOCK
- block name (inherit blockdata)
- base block tscn
- block function
- construct method, where it takes 

for example: "less than" expression block contains:
- editable line value block
- enum (for operations) value block
- editable line value block

each block is represented by a .tres
- a variation of ValueBlockData where its socketed, not enum
- a variation of ValueBlockData where its socketed, enum, and preset values for !=, ==, <, >
- a variation of ValueBlockData where its socketed, not enum

another example: "print" statement block contains:
- a variation of ValueBlockData where its socketed, not enum
its block text will be "print {}"
its function will be:
func block_function(vararg: Array[Variant]) -> Variant:
	print(vararg[0])
