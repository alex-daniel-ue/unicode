- Block selection
	Dragging from CapBlocks (or Blocks with no LowerLip) should drag all below it

- Function block functionality
	- child_exiting_tree & child_entered_tree, function block will have reference to 
	constructed statementblock for itself
	- from blockdata, text = ("%s" % func_name) + ("{}" * len(args))
	- function is reference towards functionblock, then _iterate_children
	- share scope? probably (treat as nestedblock)
- Array block

- Control flow blocks
	for, repeat, return
- "Get {} element of {}" block (for array)
- Increment, decrement block
- Initialize variable block
	if existing, get val, if not set val (scope.get_or_add)
	use function_set_var?
- Syntactic sugar block?
	+=, -=, /=, *=, %= ?
- Boolean operator block
	AND, OR, NOT

- Puzzle environment
- Pickup entity (trash, papers, etc.)
- Environment reset on play (needs loading from pre-set data!)
	think about format of levels (xml/json?)
		scene
		win condition?
