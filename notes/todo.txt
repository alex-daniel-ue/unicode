- Blocks some levels deep shouldn't get rendered (or be invisible) when previewing?
- player shouldn't be able to drag blocks inside blocks (like pre-set socketed blocks)
- finally do block text and basic functions



input value blocks
socket value blocks

function (name) (arg/s)/[enum]
move [directions]
print/say (string)

declare variable (name)
set variable [name from var_list] to (value)
(value) [operation] (value)

if <condition>

while <>

for {value} in (list)
repeat ()
