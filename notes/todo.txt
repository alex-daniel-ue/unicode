- Block selection
- Blocks some levels deep shouldn't get rendered (or be invisible) when previewing?
	Reduces duplicate lag (even on my machine)
- Editable LineEdit ValueBlocks change color based on detected value type
- _set_block_owner in block.gd should skip known already-set by amount of
	children of non-set. does that make sense?
- Dragging from CapBlocks (or Blocks with no LowerLip) should drag all below it
- Block duplicate (right click)

- Natural error popup
- Proper in-game print/log block

- Function block functionality
	- child_exiting_tree & child_entered_tree, function block will have reference to 
	constructed statementblock for itself
	- from blockdata, text = ("%s" % func_name) + ("{}" * len(args))
	- function is reference towards functionblock, then _iterate_children
	- share scope? probably (treat as nestedblock)
- Array block
- Dictionary block

- Control flow blocks
	for, repeat, break, continue, return
- "Get {} element of {}" block (for arrays, dictionaries)
- Increment, decrement block
- Initialize variable block
	if existing, get val, if not set val (scope.get_or_add)
	use function_set_var?
- Syntactic sugar block?
	+=, -=, /=, *=, %= ?
- Boolean operator block
	AND, OR, NOT

- Puzzle environment
- Run program button, where to put?
- Entity class
- Pickup entity (trash, papers, etc.)
- Player entity
	Movement
	Detection
	what else?
