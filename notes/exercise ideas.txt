these are ideas for exercises that build upon previous knowledge to recreate
popular abstractions in coding like for loops, repeat, initialization
though ones like "if else" that rely on more low-level instructions like JUMP
won't be covered, probably only up to C++ low-level



function (name) (arg/s)/[enum]

for {value} in (list)
repeat ()

exercises
- function demonstration
	expose function and basic say
- variable declaration & initialization
	declare (name)
	set variable [name] to (value)
- array demonstration
	
- for loop
	expose array
	declare (counter)
	declare (item)
	while <>
- repeat ()
	use for block and range block
